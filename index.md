## Experienced With
**Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **Terraform**, **AWS · Azure · GCP · Hybrid & Private Clouds · Dedicated Servers**, monitoring (**Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **Site24x7**, **ELK**), and CI/CD using **GitLab CI,** **Jenkins** and **GitHub Actions**.

## What I Do
- **CI/CD**: build and optimize pipelines, reduce release times, and improve stability.
- **Kubernetes**: design clusters, deploy applications, configure ingress, observability, and auto-scaling.
- **IaC**: describe infrastructure as code to make it reproducible and testable.

## Recent Projects
- Migrated from GitLab CI to GitHub Actions, improving build speed by 35%.
- Developed multi-cloud Terraform modules for AWS and GCP.
- Implemented 24/7 monitoring and alerting (SLO/SLI).
