## Experienced With
**Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **Terraform**, **AWS/GCP/Azure**, monitoring (**Prometheus**, **Grafana**), and CI/CD using **GitLab CI** and **GitHub Actions**.

## What I Do
- **CI/CD** — build and optimize pipelines, reduce release times, and improve stability.
- **Kubernetes** — design clusters, deploy applications, configure ingress, observability, and auto-scaling.
- **IaC** — describe infrastructure as code to make it reproducible and testable.

## Recent Projects
- Migrated from GitLab CI to GitHub Actions, improving build speed by 35%.
- Developed multi-cloud Terraform modules for AWS and GCP.
- Implemented 24/7 monitoring and alerting (SLO/SLI).
