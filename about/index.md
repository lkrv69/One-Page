      <h2>Craft built through real-world grit</h2>
      <p class="lead">Every step sharpened the way I design systems — from keeping factories running to orchestrating multi-cloud platforms.</p>

      <li>
        <span class="year">Sievierodonetsk → Kharkiv</span>
        <h3>Learning to keep the plan alive</h3>
        <p>Construction sites, retail shifts, climbing instruction, even sawmills — early jobs taught discipline, safety, and respect for systems that must not fail.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="year">Czech Republic</span>
        <h3>Factory shifts to fund the dream</h3>

        <h3>15 years of tinkering with live services</h3>
        <p>Running game servers and communities demanded Linux admin work, backups, migrations, and on-call habits long before it was my job.</p>

        <span class="year">Since 2022</span>
