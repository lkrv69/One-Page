# About Me

👋 I’m a DevOps Engineer whose journey into tech was anything but ordinary.  
📍 Born in Sievierodonetsk, Ukraine, I worked on construction sites 🏗️, in supermarkets 🛒, at sawmills 🌲, and even as a climbing wall instructor 🧗‍♂️ in Kharkiv’s Gorky Park. I spent time in factories in the Czech Republic 🇨🇿 - because sometimes survival came before dreams.

💻 But technology was always in my life. Fifteen years ago, I started running game servers 🎮, managing forums 💬, and experimenting with online services 🌐. These side projects became the foundation for my career.

🚀 Breaking into IT took years of persistence, but I eventually joined my dream company as a systems engineer. Then war came to my country 💔. Despite the chaos, I stayed and kept building - because creating reliable systems, even in unreliable times, is what I do.

⚙️ Today, I design and maintain scalable cloud infrastructure ☁️, CI/CD pipelines 📦, and observability stacks 📊 for high-availability environments.

**Stack**: Docker 🐳, Kubernetes ☸️, Helm ⎈, Terraform 🌍, Ansible 🤖, AWS/GCP/Azure ☁️, Prometheus 📡, Grafana 📈, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI.

💡 I believe no path is too hard if you keep walking. Challenges are just stages in the journey - and I’m ready for the next one.
