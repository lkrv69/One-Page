## My Story
I was born in Sievierodonetsk, Ukraine.  
Before tech became my profession, I worked almost everywhere: on construction sites, as a helper in supermarkets, as a climbing wall instructor in Gorky Park (Kharkiv), and even at factories in the Czech Republic. When money was short, I returned to Ukraine and worked in sawmills and manufacturing plants.

But alongside all these jobs, I was always drawn to technology. I started with small side projects — running Lineage 2 game servers, managing chats and gaming forums — and step by step moved into building real infrastructure for e-commerce and beyond.

Breaking into IT wasn’t easy, but persistence paid off. I joined my dream company as a systems engineer. And then, war came to my country. Yes — the war in Ukraine you’ve heard about. Despite the chaos and challenges, I stayed, continuing to work, learn, and build.

## Today
Now, I design and maintain reliable CI/CD pipelines, scalable cloud infrastructure, and monitoring systems that keep services running 24/7. My toolkit includes **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **Terraform**, **AWS/GCP/Azure**, **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and CI/CD with **GitLab CI** and **GitHub Actions**.

## What Drives Me
I don’t know exactly what the future holds, but I know one thing: *the road is made by walking*. And I’m ready for new adventures, challenges, and opportunities — anywhere in the world.
