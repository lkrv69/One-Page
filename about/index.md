## My Journey
I was born in Sievierodonetsk, Ukraine, and my first jobs had nothing to do with IT.  
I worked on construction sites, in supermarkets, at a sawmill, and even as a climbing wall instructor in Kharkiv’s Gorky Park. Later, I took shifts at factories in the Czech Republic — because sometimes survival came before dreams.

But technology was always in my life. Fifteen years ago, I started running game servers, managing forums, and experimenting with online services. Those late-night projects became the foundation for the engineer I am today.

Breaking into IT took years of persistence. Eventually, I joined my dream company as a systems engineer. Then the war came to my country. Despite the chaos, I stayed and kept building — because creating reliable systems, even in unreliable times, is what I do.

## Today
I design and maintain CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure, and monitoring systems for high-availability environments. My stack includes **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **Terraform**, **AWS/GCP/Azure**, **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **GitLab CI**, and **GitHub Actions**.

## What I Believe
I’ve learned that no path is too hard if you keep walking. Challenges are just stages in the journey.  
If you’re looking for someone who can build, adapt, and deliver under any conditions — let’s talk.
