# About Me

I'm a DevOps Engineer with 4+ years of experience building cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and automation for high-traffic products.
I enjoy performance tuning, clean architectures, and designing platforms that make deployments boring (in the best way).

**Stack**: Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, Ansible, AWS/GCP/Azure, Prometheus, Grafana, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI.
